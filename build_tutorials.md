Github
=========
Note: this approach works on all platforms as long as you have at least python installed on your machine (for mobile devices use a python IDE that runs python natively not on a server)

Download the github version at https://github.com/DaylumGD/GDLive
using python run GDLive.py

Keep in mind i would not reccomend this method especially if your on mobile scince every time you want to open GDLive you need to repeat that process
